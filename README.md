# some-deep-thoughts

## Description
This is a social media application that enables users to sign up or log in so they'll have access to writing their thoughts, seeing thoughts from other users and friends, and leaving reactions to existing thoughts. It allows users to interact with one another in a more intimate virtual space.

## Technologies used 
This is a single-page app that uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) for full-stack development, with React for the front end and the rest for the back end.
